## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

1. Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.
